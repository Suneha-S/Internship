Objective: Analyze patient no-shows in medical appointments and build a model to predict them.

Steps Involved:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Evaluation & Interpretation

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:
Identified key factors influencing no-shows (e.g., age, SMS reminders, health status)

This project analyzes a dataset of over 110,000 medical appointments from Brazil to identify the key factors behind patient no-shows. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the study follows a complete data science workflow â€” from cleaning and exploring the data to building and evaluating a predictive model. Key factors such as age, SMS reminders, and medical conditions are found to significantly influence whether a patient attends their appointment. The project concludes with a machine learning model capable of predicting no-shows.
